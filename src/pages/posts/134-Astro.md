There's a simple secret to building a faster website — _just ship less_.

Unfortunately, modern web development has been trending in the opposite direction—towards _more._ More JavaScript, more features, more moving parts, and ultimately more complexity needed to keep it all running smoothly.

Today I'm excited to publicly share Astro: a new kind of static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance with a modern developer experience.

To design Astro, we borrowed the best parts of our favorite tools and then added a few innovations of our own, including:

- **Bring Your Own Framework (BYOF):** Build your site using React, Svelte, Vue, Preact, web components, or just plain ol' HTML + JavaScript.
- **100% Static HTML, No JS:** Astro renders your entire page to static HTML, removing all JavaScript from your final build by default.
